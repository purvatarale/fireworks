# 🎆 Fireworks  
### *An Anti-Boredom Fireworks App (a.k.a. the Click-to-Dopamine Machine)*  

As the holiday season tiptoes closer, fireworks are getting ready to paint the sky…  
but I wanted a little magic **now**.  
So I built a soft, cozy, click-to-sparkle app where every tap sends a burst of color into your own mini night sky.

It’s a simple project I made in my free moments;  
part boredom cure, part ADHD fidget, part “ooo shiny!” energy.  
If you love calming visuals, tiny explosions of color, or apps you can just vibe with…

**Then this little canvas might be your new comfort corner.**

## ✨ What Is This?

A lightweight **JavaScript + HTML Canvas** app where every click creates a firework explosion.  
No rules. No limits. Just boom-boom sparkly chaos.

Perfect for:

- 🧠 ADHD minds that need “just one more click”  
- 😴 Fighting boredom  
- 🎨 Visual stimming  
- 🔥 Random bursts of joy  
- 🤯 Anyone who enjoys seeing things explode (peacefully)

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Open the app  
2. Click anywhere on the screen  
3. Watch the fireworks  
4. Click again  
5. Repeat until your soul feels lighter ✨

## 🧡 Why I Made This

Because sometimes the brain says:  
**“Let’s build something pointless but pretty.”**  
So I obeyed.
